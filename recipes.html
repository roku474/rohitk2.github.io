                <p class="vtext">This Jiggly Japanese Cheesecake recipe was one of the first difficult cakes that I attempted. 
                    While I did mess up on many of my attempts, it was still delicious everytime. 
                    On my best try, it was absolutely amazing and ended up as my favorite recipe. 
                    I highly recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a bigger baking challenge with an amazing reward.</p>

                    This Tres Leches recipe was a very unique experience for me.
                    I had this cake one time while I was on a vacation, and I was very surprised by its texture when I first had it.
                    I asked what it was, and the baker sent me this recipe, so now I am passing it along even further. 
                    I found the entire process very novel with how the cake has to be prepared over time.
                    If anyone else wants an entirely new baking experience, I very much recommend this recipe.

                    This Mirror Glaze recipe was not something I did for the flavor, but rather the aesthetic.
                    As you can see just by the thumbnail, mirror glaze cakes look nothing like their normal counterparts.
                    With a very special way of making this glaze, the outer layer ends up with this shiny surface that just looks gorgeous.
                    If you want to make something quite visually appealing, I think this recipe is perfect for you.
